# Random Work Samples
This is a repository for all my explorations in Programming.
The Repo contains the follow code:
1) **Cubic Bezier Curve in Octave**(*Filename:bezcurve.m*. See about Cubic Bezier Curves: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BÃ©zier_curve)
2) **Weighted Quick Union ADT in C**(*Filename:Wt_Quick_union.c*. See about Quick Union: https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/15uf/)
